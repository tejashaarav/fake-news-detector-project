# fake-news-detector-project
a model that can properly categorise news as REAL or FAKE.
This python project for identifying false news is concerned with the difference between fake and true news. On our dataset, we use sklearn to create a TfidfVectorizer. After that, we fit the model using a PassiveAggressive Classifier. Finally, the accuracy score and confusion matrix indicate how well our model performs.
